aboutGoal = <b>Goal:</b> To sink all of your opponent's ships by correctly guessing their location.<br>
aboutSetup = <b>Setup:</b> Each player has a board with two girds and a set number of ships each with a specified size. The top grid is used to track your shots at the opponent's ships. The bottom grid is used to place your ships vertically or horizontally (not diagonally) across grid spaces, and cannot hang over the grid. Ships can touch each other, but can't both be on the same space. The bottom grid is also used to track the opponent's shots at your ships.<br>
aboutPlay = <b>Play:</b> Players take turns firing a shot to attack enemy ships. On your turn, left-click on a space to shoot there. If there is no ship there, it will be a 'miss' and marked white. If there is a ship, it will be a 'hit' and marked red. The markings are the same when your opponent shoots at your ships. When every space of a ship is marked red, the ship is sunk.<br>
aboutVictory = <b>Victory:</b> The first player to sink all of the other player's ships wins.
